\section{Introduction} 
In this assignment the aim was to specify three different possible
data representations for a spreadsheet application. The
representations were to be described such that they could be implemented
from the descriptions.
 
Several criteria to judge the suitability of the chosen representations were 
discussed in the mandatory seminar \emph{OU2}. Three of those criteria 
were then to be used to judge the chosen data representations.

Below follows a translation of the the problem description given in Swedish
on the course homepage:

\begin{quote}
Imagine that you work with the development of a spreadsheet software
(Excel). The spreadsheet is basically a single large table with rows
and columns. Each cell has a unique address in the form of a row and a
column coordinate. For simplicity, let's represent both of them as an
integer (normally columns are represented by character combinations,
but the transformation to and from is trivial). The table is basically 
of infinite size and the user fills in just some cells here and
there. Obviously, it's not possible to represent all cells as they are
of infinite count. Neither is it very economic to to represent the
finit number of cells that fit in the thought minimum rectangle
that includes all non-empty cells as still many included cells can be
empty. The aim is to find a more economic representation of the
spreadsheet. There are potentially many different viable
representations. The assignment is to come up with three different
representations for a spreadsheet and discuss pros and cons for each
of them. However the first step is to determine suitable such criteria
for evaluating the represantation.
\end{quote}


\subsection{Interpretation of the Problem Descrition}
The quoted text defines a spreadsheet as a 'table'. Hence,
a spreadsheet can be seen seen as a potentially infinite table. A
requirement given in the description is that the implementation has to
be more economic than an virtual rectangular structure engufling all
non-empty table elements.

\subsection{Typical Usecases of a Spreadsheet}
During a typical user session, text, numbers, formulas and links to
other elements are stored in the table elements. In many usecases the
number of filled elements will be very low compared to the
rectanglular set of elements that engulfs the outermost non-empty
table elements. This relation will be further on called \emph{fill
  ratio}.



\subsection{Fast and Large or Slow and Small}
The most general criteria applicable for in most cases of data
structures are \emph{Time} and \emph{Space}. Most design choices come
down to a trade-off between how execution speed and amount of needed
memory. 


\subsection{Chosen Datatypes}
\subsubsection{table}
As most obvious datatype table was chose. More specific, the
construction of the table has to be such that it can grow
and shrink dynamically. This was true for a table constructed from a
list. 

\subsubsection{Binary trees}
Binary search trees offer a good time complexity. A table can be
implemented as one tree for the rows and multiple trees for the
columns in each row. 

\subsubsection{Directed Graph and Hash Table}
Nodes are
